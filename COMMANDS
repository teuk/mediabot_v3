Commands of Mediabotv2 Last revised: Feb 04, 2018

INTRODUCTION

The bot connects to a random irc server attached to defined network in config file

Then it will join console channel (you should have added one during configure stage)

Note : 
If user mode +x is set on Undernet network, it will use a random nick and wait for X successfull login
Then the bot try to change to its defined nick

If freenode network type is defined and a password is defined it will authenticate to NickServ

At the begining the database USER table is empty and you have to register an Owner user with :

/msg mediabot register <username> <password>

Ex : /msg mediabot register Logan W0lv3r|ne

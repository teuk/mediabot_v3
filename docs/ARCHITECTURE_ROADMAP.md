# Mediabot architecture roadmap

Accepted by the maintainer on 2026-11-11, after review of MB1207
(`d2efb58ddea9c370505b92639e2973233d2d02e0`).

This is the durable continuation plan. Read it before proposing the next
structural change and update its progress in the same patch as that change.
Use small reversible deliveries; do not bundle every phase into one migration.
Existing plugin architecture and API v2/v3 compatibility remain authoritative.

## Progress and sequence

| Phase | Objective and bounded first increment | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Isolate Partyline `.plugins` administration behind explicit dependencies; keep historical entry points. | MB1208 implemented; target-host integration/full suite acceptance pending. |
| B | Reduce Helpers' responsibilities and bidirectional dependencies. Map one output-policy path, give it a single owner, retain compatibility delegates. | Next after A acceptance. |
| C | Separate domain data access from commands and IRC transport. Pilot channel output rules, retaining cache freshness, last-known-good data and failure policy. | Planned. |
| D | Make timer/worker/resource ownership and shutdown order explicit. Inventory existing resources first; migrate one family with idempotent cleanup. Distinguish shutdown, IRC reconnect and rehash. | Planned. |
| E | Reduce PluginManager responsibilities. Extract runtime-state persistence and diagnostics separately while keeping lifecycle/security authority explicit. | Planned. |
| Throughout | Replace source-body reconstruction with actual component tests and injected clock/transport/storage dependencies; retain native integration tests. | Started in MB1208 (412, 1110). |

## Phase A / MB1208

`Mediabot::Partyline::PluginAdmin` owns parsing, operator permission checks and
presentation for `.plugins`. It loads only core Perl dependencies and receives:

- the plugin manager, through its existing method interface;
- a writer exposing `write`;
- lazy providers for session level, optional autoload state and metrics.

`Partyline::Commands::_cmd_plugins` supplies those dependencies. Existing
Partyline methods and rendering helper aliases remain compatible. The manager
still owns plugin lifecycle, capabilities, storage namespaces and persistence.
This component is trusted operator code, not a sandbox or plugin capability API.

The command cases now invoke the real component without loading the entire bot.
Native Partyline lifecycle, config, storage and alias tests remain in the host
acceptance lane. The remaining large command body can later be separated into
parsing and rendering if concrete tests justify another increment.

Acceptance: exact wire responses, level gates, delegated operations, redaction,
compatibility aliases and command routing preserved; no additional repository
test file; full suite once before commit. Do not mark host acceptance complete
merely because the patch has been prepared or uploaded. Record the successful
host result/commit in the next delivery.

## Rules for subsequent phases

1. Record the base revision and compare supplied source snapshots explicitly.
2. Describe ownership and dependencies before and after each change; fewer lines
   in a file alone are not evidence of architectural improvement.
3. Preserve commands, permissions, wire output and default behavior. Any intended
   behavior change needs its own explanation and tests.
4. Keep SQL failure policies domain-specific: authorization, optional archives,
   output rules and writes must not share an indiscriminate fallback policy.
5. Keep security checks at an identified authority; avoid a second inconsistent
   copy in a generic service container.
6. Use explicit dependencies at the extracted boundary, preserving lazy access
   when timing matters. Retain compatibility facades until callers are migrated.
7. No database schema, production configuration or service changes in this plan
   unless separately requested. Radio and YouTube behavior remain sensitive.
8. Validate focused contracts and native wiring, then the full suite once with
   visible progress on the host. Commit/push with the existing commit.sh flow.
9. Record measured test/startup effects when available; do not promise a speedup
   from extraction alone. Never delete coverage only to reduce the test count.

## Completion criteria

- Components can be loaded/tested without unrelated runtime dependencies.
- Each cache, worker and timer has an identifiable owner and lifecycle policy.
- Domain SQL operations live behind named interfaces with explicit error rules.
- The runtime coordinates services; transport and commands do not accumulate
  unrelated business rules.
- Integration tests cover compatibility facades and native runtime wiring.
